        You must have landed on this page because you have received an{' '}
        <strong>Onboarding email</strong> and a new laptop from your employer.

      <p>
        Please keep the email at hand and donâ€™t delete it. It contains your
        personal link to the <strong>One-Click Installer</strong> that you are
        going to need later in the process.

        device. Excited?
