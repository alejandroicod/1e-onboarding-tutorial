        Welcome to the tutorial! I am going to be your assistant during this
        process. I might suggest you tips or explanations along the process for
        a better understanding. Remember that if you ever need more help, you

        This tutorial will guide you through the onboarding process of your

        managed by your employer. It is going to be a simple and smooth task
        that will take you a couple of clicks.
