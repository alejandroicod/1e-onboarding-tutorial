      <Tip>
        Welcome to the tutorial! I am going to be your assistant during this
        process. I might suggest you tips or explanations along the process for
        a better understanding. Remember that if you ever need more help, you
        can use the <strong>Need Help?</strong> button at the bottom left of the
        screen.

      <p>
        You must have landed on this page because you have received an{' '}
        <strong>Onboarding email</strong> and a new laptop from your employer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please keep the email at hand and donâ€™t delete it. It contains your
        personal link to the <strong>One-Click Installer</strong> that you are
        going to need later in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        This tutorial will guide you through the onboarding process of your new
        device. Excited?
